# CARE4CF Daily Logging App. 

## Abstract
People with Cystic Fibrosis often spend around two hours each day on treatments to try and stay well. The most time-consuming of these treatments are airway clearance treatments, a form of chest physiotherapy. Many people with CF choose to replace airway clearance with exercise, and the CARE4CF trial aims to study whether people with CF can do so without getting sicker as a result. The CARE4CF App will be used by ~1,000 people with CF to log what airway clearance activities they do each day - whether theyâ€™ve done their normal routine, something different (and if so, what) or no activities. It is a progressive web app, using recent technologies to create an installable web app with offline functionality and push notifications.

This app is a progressive web app. Feel free to install it to your device's home screen to use locally, or to use it via a browser. 

Once logged in and registered, you will be asked to save your first airway clearance routine. Fill out the details and submit. 

Once you've saved your routine, you're free to use the app to log each day's activities. You are presented each day with the option to log your normal routine, something different or no activities. 

You may also view and edit your normal and saved routines, and view your logging history in a calendar format along with your logging streaks.
